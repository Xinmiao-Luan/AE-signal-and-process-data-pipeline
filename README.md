# AE-signal-and-process-data-pipeline
This is a modular Python toolkit for multimodal data fusion in manufacturing.

This project takes acoustic emission (AE) spectrograms, learns latent representations with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and aligns them with process data from other sensors (e.g., machine logs, coordinates, process parameters). 
By combining signal-based features with process-level context, the pipeline enables defect detection, anomaly monitoring, and quality assurance in Directed Energy Deposition (DED) and related manufacturing processes.
